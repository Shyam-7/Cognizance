## Benifits of solving puzzles

<br>
    Solving puzzles is increasing our mental speed and short-term memory by remembering colors, shapes, and details and then helps us to think where is the right place for our piece. Crossword puzzles are one of the best cognitive exercises, as well as Jigsaw puzzles.
<br>
     Problem-solving skills are very important in our life. Having these skills means you are able to identify the problem and find the best solution for it. If you train your brain by solving puzzles you can improve these skills.

<br>

## Why puzzles?

     Studies show itâ€™s important to use every part of your brain to keep it   from weakening over time. Solving puzzles helps the brain engage in a  stimulating cognitive activity.

    Basically, the more you work different parts of your brain, the easier it becomes to grow new neural connections, keeping your brain sharp. Recent studies also show that, through word puzzles, older adults are able to keep their brain level functioning up to 10 years younger their age.
